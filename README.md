# sWiZZleee's React w/ TypeScript template

This template is meant to serve as a simple boilerplate for me and anyone else who wants to quickly scaffold a React w/ TypeScript project. I have attempted to keep things unopinionated, simple and clean to allow developers a much clear path to customization and setting up their codebase the way they like it.

This project and especially the README.md has a lot more work that needs to be put into it but at this point in time I am happy to work of this template how it is and work on adjusting other specifics and minor details later on. If you feel like contributing or suggesting any changes that you would like to see or use please feel free to make a PR or contact me directly.
